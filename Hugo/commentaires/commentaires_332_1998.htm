                G. Yes, around 15 pages. I think I have improved my writing skills 

                from these papers.<br>

                H. They were useful. About 15 pages of writing. We had rewrites 

                - that was very helpful.<br>

                I. Probably wrote around 20 pages - writing assignments were always 

                relevant.<br>

                Very good teacher, well organized, loves what she does, I'm still 

                not confident about my grammar, maybe some brush up session, or 

                required index cards for vocab, worksheets would help with that.<br>
