              Research is, of course, learning. And both true, long-term learning 
              and research are inquiries provoked by intellectual curiosity. So 
              teachers must support, challenge, and focus inquiry in curious students 
              and provoke intellectual curiosity in students who have not yet 
              realized what they are missing. Many professors do this by modeling 
              their thought processes for students; I also figure out ways to 
              teach students how to engage in such processes (see the Hugo research 
              project <a href="../../Hugo/precision.htm">Pr&eacute;cision de sujet 
              activity</a>, for example). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Similarly, 
                in pursuing both research and learning, one works in an academically 
                rigorous and honest way, aiming for clarity of thought and expression, 
                as well as for accuracy. As I actively pursue a research agenda, 
                then, I inherently model many qualities of academic rigor for 
                my students and, on a practical level, keep up to date with the 
                research tools I teach them to use. For my recognition of this 
                overarching sort of synergy and mutual value of research and teaching, 
                I credit my colleague Bob Cook and <a href="http://trc.virginia.edu/Publications/OP_Cook/Cook_Foreword.htm" target="_blank">his 
                articulation of some whys and hows of research and teaching</a>.

              Teaching is a manifestation of inquiry rather than of doctrine. 
              And research is prolonged and focused inquiry. Thus a good teacher 
              must frequently think in ways similar to those of a researcher, 
              considering what, how, and why students are learning and figuring 
              out how to improve the process. My classroom research includes a 
              variety of techniques, such as the <a href="http://trc.virginia.edu/Publications/Teaching_Concerns/Spring_1991/TC_Spring_1991_One_Minute_Paper.htm" target="_blank">one-minute 
              paper</a> to see how well students grasp recently discussed material; 
              <a href="http://trc.virginia.edu/Publications/Teaching_Concerns/Spring_1993/TC_Spring_1993_Loevinger.htm" target="_blank">mid-semester 
              comments</a> to gather their ongoing impressions of and suggestions 
              to improve the course (<a href="../summary_332.htm">sample comments</a>); 
              a <a href="http://trc.virginia.edu/Consultations/TAP.htm" target="_blank">Teaching 
              Analysis Poll</a> to enable them to share their ideas about the 
              course and to provide me a majority, overall perspective; analysis 
              of final student evaluations to improve future courses (<a href="../../Hugo/commentaires/commentaires_index.htm">sample 
              evaluations</a>). </font></p>
              
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Since 
              long-term learning comes from one's deep engagement with information 
              and ideas, and since people most easily and deeply engage with ideas 
              they find inherently interesting, I incorporate <a href="../../Hugo/projet_de_recherche.htm">research 
              projects</a> for students into some courses in order to promote 
              better learning and to develop skills of inquiry. In this way, each 
              student can, and does, become an expert in some aspect of the course. 
              I believe that some of them also learn more about the value of pursuing 
              research to new understandings. In all courses, I also engage students' 
              sense of inquiry through assignments and class activities (see <a href="../strategies_strengths.htm">Strategies 
              and Strengths</a>). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Beginning 
                with my experiences as a graduate student teaching assistant, 
                most of my research projects have been inspired by something that 
                happened in a course. My interest in investigating how American 
                students read and understand in French grew initially from questions 
                my Harvard students asked when reading with me during office hours. 
                Sometimes their questions made little sense until I had probed 
                further, discovering underlying misconceptions that had impelled 
                them down a garden path of interpretation. Students thus provoked 
                me to think more deeply about how we can ascertain what happens 
                inside a reader's brain. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">What 
                I have discovered when conducting experiments with American students 
                reading French (<a href="../Research%20Interests/research_interests.htm" target="_blank">research 
                summary</a>) has furthered my respect for students as independent 
                thinkers and as individuals. I find myself forever acknowledging 
                the remarkably individual nature of the reading process, despite 
                my concurrent recognition that statistical studies can help us 
                to define general levels of reading competence and to elucidate 
                trends among a group of students. Recognizing and analyzing the 
                unending variety of reading styles that encompass a multiplicity 
                of strategies, techniques, and approaches requires the same flexibility 
                of mind that I try to engineer into my teaching. </font></p>
              
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
              through my research, I have discerned many of the ways in which 
              people understand and (misunderstand) what they read. Thus I am 
              intrigued to discover how each student tackles a text, and on what 
              understandings each bases her or his interpretations. Frequently, 
              I explore my own students' thinking processes by asking them to 
              write a <a href="recall_protocol.htm">recall protocol</a>, a flowing 
              statement of what they remember from an assigned text. My analysis 
              of these remembrances (typically used in reading research) shows 
              me a great deal about how individual students read: whether they 
              look for details or make sweeping generalizations, are careful or 
              lax, note syntax or ignore it, and so on. </font></p>
              
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">The desire 
              to keep and develop an open, flexible mind, together with an ongoing 
              curiosity about how people learn, drives my teaching and research. 
              Thus I have branched out beyond reading research, first to delve 
              into the <a href="../Research%20Interests/writing_process.htm" target="_blank">writing 
              process in a foreign language</a>. That study led me to appreciate 
              individual writing processes and styles, as well as the difficulty 
              of learning to write persuasive essays. One of my top priorities 
              in my courses is teaching students how to create solid thesis statements 
              and valid supporting arguments (see <a href="../strategies_strengths.htm">Strategies 
              and Strengths</a>). My study of what cultural differences there 
              might be in terms of <a href="../Research%20Interests/thinking_reflectively.htm" target="_blank">reflective 
              thinking in the humanities</a> is an expansion of my interest in 
              writing in a foreign language. The integration of my thinking on 
              teaching and research has resulted in articles that have been recognized 
              by several awards from outside agencies, including <a href="../../Vitae%20and%20Bio/vitae_bio_1.htm#awards">awards</a> 
              for articles on foreign language reading and writing. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Most 
              recently, the revitalization of my interest in the works and life 
              of Victor Hugo that led me to create <a href="../../Hugo/HugoIndex.htm">FREN 
              355</a> has also energized me to write an anthology targeted toward 
              French-speaking readers outside of France. The research involved 
              in creating an anthology feeds directly into the knowledge and understanding 
              necessary to teach the course. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2"><b>Conclusion</b><br>
                I find myself lucky to work in a discipline that is inherently 
                interdisciplinary: that includes work on language, culture, history, 
                politics, sociology, literature, critical-thinking skills, and 
                so on. Moreover, French studies, together with my work in faculty 
                development and pedagogy, have led me to explore in several different 
                directions, an interaction that keeps my research and teaching 
                equally alive and in balance. </font></p>
