              didn't understand why he was left. He seemed a little upset because 
              he had been waiting to die and now they were making him live longer 
              to ponder death some more. The soldiers took him to one of their 
              superiors who kept asking him where to find Ramon Gris. He kept 
              trying to intimidate Pablo and was very phony. Pablo said he didn't 
              know where to find Ramon Gris. The fat, phony guy told him that 
              he would let him live if he told them where to find Ramon. Then 
              they sent him to his cell [the laundry] to think about it. He decided 
              that, though he knew where Ramon was, he wasn't going to tell on 
              him. He didn't even like Ramon anymore, but he felt he was ready 
              for death-a &quot;proper death.&quot; He decided to make up a story 
              about where Ramon was. He told the soldiers he was in the cemetery 
              (he was really supposed to be at his cousin's house hiding). The 
              soldiers told him he would be sorry if he was lying. After the soldiers 
              came back from searching for Ramon, they put Pablo in a giant camp 
              with all kinds of prisoners (even women and children). They were 
              fed at a dining hall in this prison. He didn't understand why they 
              let him live. It turns out, as the baker told him, that Ramon had 
              had a fight with his cousins. He really did go to hide out in the 
              cemetery where the soldiers shot him as he resisted arrest. When 
              Pablo heard this, he laughed out loud. </font></p>

                description of the sky is very positive again at this point, probably

              <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">They 
                ask Pablo to tell them where some guy they're after is, but Pablo 
                refuses to tell. They put him in some room to be alone for 15 
                minutes to think about whether he should tell them or not. Pablo 
                knows exactly where the guy is, but after15 min. are up he makes 
                some story about where the guy is, leading the &quot;bad guys&quot; 
                on a wild goose chase-so Pablo thinks. It turns out, however, 
                that the guy they're looking for indeed is where Pablo told them 
                he'd be, and they killed the guy. So Pablo's life is spared by 
                chance. </font></li>
              <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">I 
                remember Pablo laughing to himself a lot and thinking that &quot;the 
                bad guys&quot; were very funny-he found their methods and motivations 
                humorous, and he analyzed them very precisely. He also thought 
                the murder of the guy was funny. <br>

              and what they mean than on what happened. The analysis is not very 
              thorough, however; for instance, the final note that Pablo &quot;thought 
              the murder of the guy was funny&quot; ignores the irony and tragedy 
              of the situation, giving the impression instead that Pablo was amused.</i>

              is left alone in the basement. He thinks about the imminent death 
              of Tom and Juan but essentially feels nothing. Eventually, someone 
              comes to ask him questions about where his friend is located, telling 
              him that his life can be saved if he gives up his friend. Pablo 
              lies about where his friend is or actually makes up a random place 
              in order to stall for time. Unfortunately for the friend it turns 
              out he is actually there and they capture him and let Pablo go. 
              However, his friend is condemned to die instead. [killed in a shoot-out 
              at the cemetery.] </font></p>

              thinks that they will take him too, to kill him. He knows that he 
              lied to them about the whereabouts of his friend, so he thinks they 
              found out that he lied. Really, though, what he told them (that 
              his friend was hiding in the cemetery) turned out to be the truth. 
              So, they got the information that they wanted to get from Pablo, 
              although he doesn't think he gave them the correct information. 
              When he realizes this, he realizes he got his friend killed, but 
              he will be set free. This feeling of confusion is what we are left 
              with at the end. </font></p>

              the soldiers calls Tom, he doesn't answer. They call Juan and he's 
              bawling and they have to carry him out. Tom goes. Pablo asks why 
              he's not going too, they say wait. He gets taken before some interrogators 
              to find out where Ramon Gris is. He won't tell them. They send him 
              to a laundry room to wait some more. He thinks about why he's not 
              telling them where Ramon is. He goes in front of the man again and 
              decides to play a trick on them. He tells them Ramon is in the cemetery. 
              He just wanted see them run and scramble around-he laughs just thinking 
              about it. They come back and put him in with all the others-he won't 
              be executed. He talks with someone else he knows who says Ramon 
              was caught because he was stupid and hid in the cemetery. Pablo
