              workshop engages the participants actively in learning new information 
              or techniques. The workshop facilitator makes it possible for audience 
              members to participate actively:</font></p>

              <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Participants

              <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Participants 
                can analyze problems or difficulties in order to figure out solutions

                </font></li>
              <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Participants

            </ul>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Thus 
              you facilitate learning by the participants rather than giving them 
              all the answers.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Why

              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Experience 
              and research show that people generally learn more and remember 
              better when they think about new material, figure out solutions, 
              and apply new knowledge to their own lives and needs. Such a surmise 
              is born out by participants in U.Va. Teaching Resource Center workshops 
              who repeatedly praise interactive workshops and recommend that we 
              take advantage of the expertise in the audience. Effective workshop 
              leaders recognize and take advantage of the combined wisdom and 
              experience of the faculty and TAs who attend (see below for details). 
              Such a workshop is sometimes called &quot;process-oriented&quot; 
              because the participants productively work through a process rather 
              than simply receiving the product (your techniques).<br>

            </ul>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Almost 
              any U.Va. TRC workshop audience contains a number of people experienced 
              in teaching and/or counseling students and colleagues. Plan to treat 
              the audience members as colleagues.<br>
              Our two large teaching conferences occur in August and January, 
              just before classes begin. The August Teaching Workshop is targeted 
              toward TAs and faculty who are new to teaching at the University 
              of Virginia. Many of these &quot;new&quot; people, however, have 
              taught elsewhere and some have taught at U.Va. but are interested 
              in polishing their skills. Almost all who attend the January Teaching 
              Workshop have already taught at U.Va., with periods of time ranging 
              from one semester to decades.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Although 
              80%-90% of the Teaching Workshop participants are TAs, please remember 
              that you probably also have faculty members in your audience. Some 
              TA and faculty needs are similar; some are different. Both TAs and 
              faculty members lead discussions, for instance. But TAs most often 
              teach a discussion section that grows from a lecture class taught 
              by a professor, while faculty teach their own course with discussion 
              as at least part of the methodology. Thus the facilitator of a discussion-leading 
              workshop for a mixed audience needs to spend the most time on techniques 
              of beginning and leading a discussion that are useful in both situations. 
              Only a small part of the workshop should deal with coordinating 
              discussions with lectures and other such TA matters.<br>
              </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Analyze 
                your material / information.<br>
                </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">How can 
              you engage your audience in pinpointing difficulties and possible 
              solutions? In a workshop on teaching problem-solving strategies, 
              for example, you might ask the audience to brainstorm the skills 
              needed to solve problems. Or you could present some possibilities 
              and ask participants to supplement them. Or you could ask for anecdotes 
              or ideas about unsuccessful attempts to teach problem-solving, from 
              which you construct a list of pitfalls to avoid. After the audience 
              is actively thinking about possible problems and solutions, you 
              introduce your techniques to teach problem-solving.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">The techniques 
              segment of the workshop usually works best if participants practice 
              at least one of the techniques with each other. Small groups can 
              be particularly effective when one group member is the teacher, 
              the second the student, and the third an observer, who analyzes 
              the interaction with the help of a questionnaire (or guidelines) 
              that you provide. Remember, too, to model during your workshop the 
              techniques you are recommending (for instance, no lectures about 
              leading discussions!).<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">To prepare 
              a workshop in which participants figure out some of what you already 
              know, look analytically at your topic. TRC staff members are happy 
              to help you with this process.<br>
              </font></p>

            </ul>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">In post-workshop 
              evaluations, participants always praise workshops offering practical, 
              hands-on ideas with understandable examples. It is important to 
              choose your examples from different disciplines and apply your techniques 
              to different situations when your workshop includes participants 
              from a variety of departments. A &quot;workshop&quot; by definition 
              gives participants something they can use.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Think 
              about and research your topic enough to provide workshop participants 
              with ideas beyond simply what you do in your teaching (unless you 
              have a wide variety of techniques). The most useful and impressive 
              workshops give participants various perspectives and recognizes 
              different needs and styles. Go beyond personal anecdotes about what 
              happened to you.<br>

            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">If your 
              workshop involves the audience in determining problems, discovering 
              solutions, and making decisions, they will be too busy and engaged 
              to take lots of notes. But they want to remember what they learned 
              two months later when they have an immediate need for the information. 
              So note your main points and describe useful techniques well enough 
              for someone to make sense of them sometime in the future. We also 
              make handouts available to those who could not attend a session, 
              and they are very helpful to someone watching a videotape of your 
              session.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">Decide 
              ahead of time whether you will distribute your handout during your 
              workshop or at the end. Each technique has different advantages. 
              Some participants find it useful to take notes on a handout, completing 
              it as the workshop progresses. Other types of handouts summarize 
              main points and can be distracting to participants who need to focus 
              on the process of the workshop.<br>

              Please give an original of your handout to the Teaching Resource 
              Center at least a day before your workshop. If you want us to make 
              copies for you, we need the original at least ten days before your 
              workshop.</font></p>

              a Teaching Workshop with concurrent sessions, participants need 
              to complete one workshop in order to arrive on time at the next. 
              In any case, any presentation that runs beyond its allotted time 
              looks disorganized to the audience. Plan your time carefully, and 
              watch it during the workshop. You may need to respond to some individual
