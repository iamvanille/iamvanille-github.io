                I think it is worthwhile to do peer editing, but in this class 

                I found that my peer editors generally said that my essays were 

                good when they in fact needed a lot of work.<br>

                B. They are good. Helped me improve my writing<br>

                C. It was good, but I feel the comments by the teacher were the 

                most helpful when rewriting my papers.<br>

                D. Peer editing I am not sure is worth everyone's time. But it 

                was good to read other people's ideas.<br>

                E. Very effective<br>

                F. I did not find the peer editing very useful. I benefited far 

                more from your comments and working with what I know needed improvements.<br>

                G. These honestly were not helpful to me. I often found that I 

                did not understand the comments made or that the editors did not 

                understand my thinking. I know time is often tight, but it would 

                help me to have time in class with the group.<br>

                H. Very effective<br>

                I. I thought that although I only used suggestion from my peers 

                a few times, it helped to read over others' papers<br>

                J. Very helpful and required you to examine other types of reading<br>

                K. I like peer editing and grading because it helps you see if 

                others (at your level) can understand what you are saying<br>

                L. Good exercise, though receiving peer edits were not always 

                helpful; good way to get other's viewpoints<br>

                M. Peer editors are usually too nice to point out what's wrong 

                with your paper. However it is helpful looking at other people's 

                work so that you can improve your own.<br>

                N. This aspect of the class was very helpful as it helped me to 

                become a better editor for others' work as well as my own.<br>

                O. Very effective- it really helped me to have another set of 

                eyes look at my paper</font></p>

                I think class discussions were very helpful for learning how to 

                comprehend French literature. Mme Barnett did an excellent job 

                involving everyone in class discussions.<br>

                B. I really enjoyed to share my ideas and to learn the ideas of 

                my colleagues<br>

                C. Class discussion was really good: Feel that it really helped 

                me French<br>

                D. Good, we usually (towards the end more) had good ones<br>

                E. Very well led. Prof. Barnett made sure every one spoke and 

                asked very thought provoking questions<br>

                F. Discussion was helpful. I t was an enjoyable part of the class<br>

                G. These were incredibly helpful-no suggestions<br>

                H. Very effective because they helped us understand the readings 

                better<br>

                I. Class discussions were very useful in helping out with analyzing 

                texts<br>

                J. Very open not intimidating, all thoughts were welcome<br>

                K. I enjoyed class discussion very much, it was comfortable and 

                I learned a lot from listening to other people's opinions<br>

                L. Good: excellent class that was talkative-very helpful. Lots 

                of discussion/ some instruction-good balance<br>

                M. Discussion is helpful only if one person does not dominate 

                the discussion and make other student uncomfortable speaking or 

                asking questions. Unfortunately that happened frequently in this 

                class.<br>

                N. Class discussions were very helpful. They helped to clarify 

                any unclear ideas and they allowed us to practice speaking.<br>

                O. More work in small groups, then discuss with class-would give 

                more in-depth discussions</font></p>

                each other better ideas<br>
