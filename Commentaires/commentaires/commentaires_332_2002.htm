              <blockquote>

<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2">a) 

                  I learned how to read and understand French texts-analytically 

                  thinking about texts- speaking with confidence- how to correct 

                  my work<br>

                  b) Improved analyzation of texts- introduced me to new material<br>

                  c) To better read, speak and write in French<br>

                  d) I learned a lot about poetry, prose and plays. Most importantly 

                  I learned to improve my writing and to think critically about 

                  others' writing<br>

                  e) A lot more than I ever could have expected- I still can't 

                  believe that at the beginning of last year I couldn't say &quot;bonjour&quot; 

                  and through this course, I'm now writing 4 and 5 page papers- 

                  analyzing literature! I picked up on a lot of grammar that I 

                  didn't learn (as I haven't taken 331) and believe I have greatly 

                  expanded my conversation, writing and reading skills overall.<br>

                  f) Improve on a basis of French. The course did not necessarily 

                  help with speaking, but did help a lot on the writing. The rigorous 

                  schedule really improved my writing. I think the fact that I 

                  have written at least 5 times more French than English this 

                  semester speaks to that<br>

                  g) To write and speak a lot in French</font></p>

                Great- it helped me in editing my own papers<br>

                B. good, but do we really need to do 2 of everyone's drafts?<br>

                C. very helpful! I especially like &quot;brainstorming with peers 

                and discussing our theses<br>

                D. very effective- I liked being able to read others' writing&#133; 

                at first I didn't like the idea of being graded on in the peer 

                editing, but overall it challenged me to think more critically<br>

                E. a great help- I think, for me, it was an even bigger help to 

                correct other peoples' essays than to have them correct mine' 

                the editing process makes you pick up on a lot of grammar/vocab 

                etc and makes you thus more aware of it as you write your own 

                papers in the future<br>

                F. very helpful, good to get opinions other than that of the professor. 

                Kind of a pain doing them in short time, because a thoughtful 

                critique takes time. But the result is very helpful<br>

                  in class<br>

                  D. Knowing that we were having discussions made me prepare the 

                  work ahead of time, so I think I got more out of it<br>

                  E. I can't believe that, even at 9:30 am, we talked as much 

                  as we did- this element of the class was also very beneficial 

                  for me, as I enjoyed the conversation in addition to the written 

                  French.<br>

                  able to write my paper without it!<br>

                  E. This was my favorite project (perhaps because I love poetry)- 

                  but the combination of reading, speaking and presenting aloud 

                  to the class was a great way to learn many different aspects 

                  of French.<br>

                  F. Preparation was more rigorous because of the level of detail 

                  hence more of a learning tool; really lets one get into the 

                  nuances of the French language; presentation to me was just 

                  like another class discussion, nothing too special<br>

                  I felt fortunate to have such intelligent peers and such a great

                  I will miss everyone next year!!<br>

                  Mme. Barnett was so helpful, so nice, so motivating&#133; no

                  B. Enthusiastic, kind<br>

                  C. Too many worksheets, course packet? She was approachable 

                  and helpful. She helped us to do our best.<br>

                  E. It is obvious she was always prepared, had excellent control 

                  over the subject matter, loves what she does, she always encouraged 

                  us to really get into the class and our work and seemed genuinely 

                  concerned with each and every one of us<br>

                  F. Very outgoing, fosters discussion, non-judgmental, gives 

                  too much work<br>
