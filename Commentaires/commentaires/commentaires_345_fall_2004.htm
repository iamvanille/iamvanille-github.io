              A literary and political giant of  nineteenth-century France, Victor Hugo was by age 25 a much-admired poet.&nbsp; Central to the romantic revolution in  theater, he was also a tireless social critic who argued for many causes,  including educational reform and abolition of the death penalty.&nbsp; When not writing novels such as&nbsp; <em>Notre-Dame  de Paris</em> and <em>les Mis&eacute;rables</em>, Hugo  was carving out a powerful political career and creating drawings and paintings  that influenced some Surrealist artists.&nbsp;  We will study Hugo&rsquo;s work in all these contexts, discussing the  universality of his themes (for instance, passionate love, familial love,  justice and injustice, liberty, the role of God).&nbsp; Our goals:&nbsp;  Appreciate his genius and find perspectives and themes that speak to  each of us individually.&nbsp; Course work  includes discussion, written assignments, group work, one exam, and a personal  research project done throughout the semester.&nbsp;  Those who take the course as FREN 493 will do a more sophisticated,  larger-scale project and a longer oral presentation.&nbsp; Course taught in French.</p>

            <ol type="a" class="style5 style3">
              <li>It required a lot of time for preparation.</li>
              <li>The challenge was doing all the writing in French &amp;  keeping up with the work load.</li>
              <li>very challenging</li>
              <li>very</li>

            <p class="style5 style3">4. <strong>How  useful did you find the writing assignments [if applicable]?&nbsp; How much writing were you required to do in  this class (double-spaced pages?)&nbsp; Please  specify such factors as rewrites and response papers.</strong></p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li class="style5 style3">I enjoyed the assignments&mdash;they helped me organize my  thoughts &amp; reactions to the material.&nbsp;  At least 4,000 words/14 pages.&nbsp; It  was stressful at times but worth it.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Yes, very good, but could use a writers workshop approach  to aid grammar development and correction skills.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">probably around 10-15 pages</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">The writing assignments were good to help me think deeply  in French.&nbsp; I wrote about 11 pages during  the year &amp; will write 8 (?) for the final project.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Writings were fair and helpful for improving my  French.&nbsp; I would have liked more time  between the 3rd paper and the final project.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Amount of writing was excellent!&nbsp; I wish we wrote more during term &amp; not at  the very end.&nbsp; Midterm should be a paper.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">They were useful.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Pretty useful, more so just to clarify how the  readings/materials personally struck us.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">3 compositions, 1 final project (2,000 words).&nbsp; The assignments helped me to improve my  written communication in French.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">They were helpful, and not too long.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">The  possibility of rewrites were helpful in that it increases our grades.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="style5 style3">7.<strong>What  do you feel are the strengths and/or weakness of this course?</strong></p>
            <ol type="a"><li class="style5 style3">I think it is very well organized and interesting and  worth the effort.&nbsp; The only problems is  that the topic is so huge and we had to leave a lot out but I still feel we  learned enough to have a good handle on Hugo.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">weaknesses&mdash;very few indeed!</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">At times I felt some of the material was repetitious.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">There is so much to cover in a short amount of time.&nbsp; But, in order to cover everything we need, we  had to do a lot of work, which is understandable.&nbsp; This course DID cover a lot &amp; did go  fairly in depth, which is a strength as well.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">You need to be self-motivated but the small class size also  forms relationships that made me want to come prepared.&nbsp; The general concern &amp; effort of the  professor was astounding.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Weakness:&nbsp; too much  breadth&mdash;not enough depth, esp. w/ <em>Ruy  Blas</em> &amp; <em>Les Mis&eacute;rables</em>.&nbsp; Strength:&nbsp;  Incredibly interesting material well chosen.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">I think that the course can be more organized.&nbsp; But, in general, it was very motivating.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">The subject is really great and the course is taught  amazingly well.&nbsp; However, I wish there  had been more historical context.&nbsp; I know  though that given the length of the semester, it would be&nbsp; compromising to the richness of the materials  covered to try to add more history&agrave;maybe  another class?</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Strengths:&nbsp;  --instructor&rsquo;s enthusiasm, knowledge; --interesting texts; --helpful  supplementary materials (Q de compr&eacute;hension, online resources, handouts).&nbsp; Weakness:&nbsp;  --syllabus hard to navigate through; --maybe assign more of written  assignments before assigning final project to allow more time to be focused on  project.</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="style5 style3">8.<strong>What  specific suggestions would you have for improving the course?</strong></p>
            <ol type="a"><li class="style5 style3">I like it the way it is.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Already discussed w/ Ms. Barnett.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">[no response]</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Perhaps split the course into two courses to slow down  &amp; go more into depth.&nbsp; <em>Les Mis&eacute;rables</em> could easily have its own  course.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">Cut out some smaller works such as some poems.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">To put <em>Les Mis</em> first then do poetry last b/c that way can tie themes of book to poetry.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">[no response]</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">I opened up a 25th anniversary edition of Ayn  Rand&rsquo;s <em>Fountainhead</em> to find her  quoting Hugo within the first paragraph of the preface.&nbsp; The quote was something along the lines of  &ldquo;If writers only wrote for their own time, I&rsquo;d break my plume in half and throw  it to the ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though we covered his  effect on his own period, I think it would be interesting to highlight the  universality and timelessness of his writing, not just in the sense of many of  his works being classics, but in terms of the role he saw for his work in the  future.&nbsp; Also, I&rsquo;m not sure where to fit  it in, but I think it would be really interesting and potentially very fruitful  to look at more criticisms of his work.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">I feel I was juggling several things at once for this  course&mdash;daily readings, compositions, final project, presentations.&nbsp; Perhaps organize assignments so that students  aren&rsquo;t always multi-tasking.</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">organized around themes</li>
              <li class="style5 style3">There are too many materials tackled during the  semester.&nbsp; Less assignments and poems  will be great.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="style5 style3">9. <strong>Did  you find the course enjoyable?&nbsp; Which  aspects?&nbsp; Please comment.</strong> </p>
            <ol type="a" class="style5 style3"><li>Yes, very much so.&nbsp;  I had never discovered the artist that is Hugo, and I&rsquo;m in awe of his  talent and perspective and vision.</li>
              <li>Yes&mdash;good reading.</li>
              <li>Yes, Mme Barnett is excellent and the material is  interesting.</li>
              <li>I really liked this course because not only did I learn  something I enjoyed, but I also improved my writing &amp; speaking skills.</li>
              <li>Yes.&nbsp; I enjoyed  that I went in knowing very little of Hugo and never felt lost, and I came out  knowing a great deal.</li>
              <li>Very!&nbsp; It was my  favorite class!&nbsp; Very well taught!&nbsp; Very interesting.</li>
              <li>Yes.&nbsp; The  discussion.</li>
